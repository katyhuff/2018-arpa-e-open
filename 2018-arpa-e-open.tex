\section{Concept Summary}
%    Describe the proposed concept with minimal jargon, and explain how it
%               addresses the Program Objectives of the FOA.


This work will implement a proof-of-concept python package demonstrating
acceleration of Monte Carlo methods (in particular, Monte Carlo for neutral
particle transport) using machine learning techniques.
Next, this work will implement a few potential acceleration methods inspired by machine
learning and optimization techniques in the literature.
Finally, these acceleration methods will be tested and compared to one another for simple
problems relevant to advanced nuclear reactor safety and design. 
This work will emphasize implementation of best practices in
scientific computing, including integrating documentation, implementing unit
tests, investigating scalability, and developing demonstration jupyter
notebooks.

\section{Innovation and Impact}
%    Clearly identify the problem to be solved with the proposed technology
%              concept.
%    Describe how the proposed effort represents an innovative and potentially
%              transformational solution to the technical challenges posed by the FOA.
Hybrid methods to reduce variance in neutral particle transport in nuclear
applications tend to be application-specific. In particular, methods generally
have been developed for fixed-source or eigenvalue calculations, but not both.
This method can be used on solution types, offering the potential for
a large application space and a broad applicability. Further, many hybrid
methods use a deterministic solution of the inverse solution to estimate problem
importance\cite{wagner_automated_1998, wagner_automated_2009,
haghighat_monte_2003, zhang_adjoint-based_2011, hoogenboom_optimum_1979} . Though methods exist that automate importance map
generation\cite{hendricks_mcnp_1985, burn_optimizing_2014,
  van_wijk_easy_2011, wagner_automated_1998, wagner_automated_2009,
haghighat_monte_2003, zhang_adjoint-based_2011, hoogenboom_optimum_1979},
they still require user knowledge to choose deterministic
parameter choices (space- and energy- mesh size, quadrature type and order,
etc.). Selecting these is a non-trivial task and dramatically affects performance
across hybrid methods. This work will automate the importance map parameter selection
and, additionally, require exclusively Monte Carlo to generate it. This is more
feasible from the user perspective and improves energy efficiency by reducing 
the Monte Carlo runtime.
%    Explain the concept's potential to be disruptive compared to existing or
%              emerging technologies.
%    Describe how the concept will have a positive impact on at least one of
%              the ARPA-E mission areas in Section I.A of the FOA.
%    To the extent possible, provide quantitative metrics in a table that
%              compares the proposed technology concept to current and emerging
%              technologies and to the appropriate Technology Category in Section I.D of
%              the FOA.


\section{Proposed Work}
%    Describe the final deliverable(s) for the project and the overall
%             technical approach used to achieve project objectives.

\input{model-fig}
%    Discuss alternative approaches considered, if any, and why the proposed
%             approach is most appropriate for the project objectives.
%    Describe the background, theory, simulation, modeling, experimental data,
%             or other sound engineering and scientific practices or principles that support
%             the proposed approach.  Provide specific examples of supporting data and/or
%             appropriate citations to the scientific and technical literature.
%    Describe why the proposed effort is a significant technical challenge and
%             the key technical risks to the project.  Does the approach require one or more
%             entirely new technical developments to succeed?  How will technical risk be
%             mitigated?
A number of attempts have been made to develop hybrid methods with broad
applicability across phase-space, such as the CADIS
methodology\cite{haghighat_monte_2003}. Many of the
existing methods that are successful use a deterministic transport
calculation on a coarse mesh solving the inverse problem to obtain an importance
estimate\cite{zhang_global_2014, zhang_adjoint-based_2011, haghighat_monte_2003,
hendricks_mcnp_1985}. Though this method will use machine learning in a novel space to
update Monte Carlo, the quality of the importance estimate will still be limited
by the quality of the results from the initial Monte Carlo simulation. The
problem physics (a very effective shield, a highly absorbing medium, etc.) will
influence particles' ability to penetrate through the problem phase-space, and
this may result in very noisy importance estimates in certain regions of the
problem\cite{van_wijk_easy_2011}. Further, this noise may exacerbate overfitting phenomena observed in
Machine Learning techniques. Because this method has a large phase-space
applicability, it may require a substantial computational burden to investigate
the method performance in tally areas (space, space-energy, space-energy-angle).

Using Monte Carlo for full-core simulation of nuclear reactors is
computationally expensive\cite{martin_challenges_2012}. This method may reduce
the variance in the solution we seek but may not overcome the computational
limitations that exist for full-core reactor simulation. We plan to
characterize the method on a diverse set of application problems, ranging from
geometrically simple to complex.
