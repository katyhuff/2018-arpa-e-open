	abstract = {In the Monte Carlo method for criticality
and static reactor analysis, computation starts at
an initial guess of source distribution and iterates
a cycle of the particle transport tracking and
population normalization. In preliminary
(inactive) cycles the source distribution is
converging to the fluctuation range of
stationarity. The subsequent cycles are called
active cycles where effective neutron
multiplication factor, interaction rate
distributions, etc., are computed. The present
work concerns an “on-the-fly” source
convergence diagnosis. At Step 1, a smaller
number of cycles preceding the current cycle are
used for the diagnosis and, once Step 1 criterion
is satisfied, the number of preceding cycles to be
used at Step 2 is increased and the checking of
Step 2 criterion is made at the cycle the increased
number of preceding cycles after the beginning
of Step 2. The process of increasing the number
of preceding cycles continues through Step 10.
These steps will improve previous on-the-fly
type diagnostics [1, 2] and are analogous to a
natural human quest; approach a solution by a
crude method and then refine the method.},

We present a general strategy to overcome this difficulty by adopting ideas and techniques from the machine learning community. We fit the unnormalized probability of the physical model to a feed-forward neural network and reinterpret the architecture as a restricted Boltzmann machine. Then, exploiting its feature detection ability, we utilize the restricted Boltzmann machine to propose efficient Monte Carlo updates to speed up the simulation of the original physical system. We implement these ideas for the Falicov-Kimball model and demonstrate an improved acceptance ratio and autocorrelation time near the phase transition point.},

One of its bottlenecks is the lack of a general and efficient update algorithm for large size systems close to the phase transition, for which local updates perform badly. In this Rapid Communication, we propose a general-purpose Monte Carlo method, dubbed self-learning Monte Carlo (SLMC), in which an efficient update algorithm is first learned from the training data generated in trial simulations and then used to speed up the actual simulation. We demonstrate the efficiency of SLMC in a spin model at the phase transition point, achieving a 10–20 times speedup.},

The uncertainty lies in finding a method which obtains this information as fast and effortlessly as possible. A number of global variance reduction techniques were tested on the ITER reference neutronics model for their applicability for performing large three-dimensional transport simulations for ITER. Among these, we propose a new method which is computationally fast and efficient in determining the a priori flux information. The new method, known as MAGIC, was found to perform well achieving an efficiency 74 times that of an analogue run; the next most efficient was FW-CADIS, performing 48 times better than analogue.},

Increases, with respect to a standard simulation, in a global figure of merit ranging up to a factor 276 for a PWR core configuration have been observed. Also, the relative error distribution was flattened substantially in all studied systems by the application of the procedure and the number of empty mesh tally cells was reduced.},

Eng., in press]. This method uses a variational functional, which employs first-order estimates of forward and adjoint fluxes, to yield a second-order estimate of a desired system characteristic – which, in this paper, is the criticality eigenvalue k. If Monte Carlo estimates of the forward and adjoint fluxes are used, each having global “first-order” errors of O(1/N), where N is the number of histories used in the Monte Carlo simulation, then the statistical error in the VVR estimation of k will in principle be O(1/N). In this paper, we develop this theoretical possibility and demonstrate with numerical examples that implementations of the VVR method for criticality problems can approximate O(1/N) convergence for significantly large values of N.},

	abstract = {The development of hybrid Monte-Carlo-Deterministic (MC-DT) approaches, taking place over the past few decades, have primarily focused on shielding and detection applications where the analysis requires a small number of responses, i.e. at the detector location(s). This work further develops a recently introduced global variance reduction approach, denoted by the SUBSPACE approach, and extends its application to reactor analysis problems, where responses are required everywhere in the phase space. In this proof-of-principle study, the SUBSPACE approach is shown to reduce the excessively long execution time of Monte-Carlo reactor physics calculations for simplified reactor geometries significantly. By way of demonstration, the SUBSPACE approach is applied to assembly level calculations used to generate the few-group homogenized cross sections. These models are typically expensive and need to be executed in the order of 103–105 times to properly characterize the few-group cross sections for downstream core-wide calculations. Applicability to k-eigenvalue core-wide models is also demonstrated in this work. Given the favorable results obtained in this work, we believe that the SUBSPACE method significantly enhances the state of the art of Monte-Carlo reactor physics analysis with particular focus on reducing the necessary runtime for achieving accurate results.},

It is realized that applying less normalizations, i.e. employing superhistories, is advantageous. Realistic test problems, both fast and thermal fission, with in- and ex-core local responses, are treated. There is a good agreement between the predicted and actual gain in efficiency.
