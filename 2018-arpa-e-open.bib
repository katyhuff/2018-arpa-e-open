	abstract = {In the Monte Carlo method for criticality
and static reactor analysis, computation starts at
an initial guess of source distribution and iterates
a cycle of the particle transport tracking and
population normalization. In preliminary
(inactive) cycles the source distribution is
converging to the fluctuation range of
stationarity. The subsequent cycles are called
active cycles where effective neutron
multiplication factor, interaction rate
distributions, etc., are computed. The present
work concerns an {\textquotedblleft}on-the-fly{\textquotedblright} source
convergence diagnosis. At Step 1, a smaller
number of cycles preceding the current cycle are
used for the diagnosis and, once Step 1 criterion
is satisfied, the number of preceding cycles to be
used at Step 2 is increased and the checking of
Step 2 criterion is made at the cycle the increased
number of preceding cycles after the beginning
of Step 2. The process of increasing the number
of preceding cycles continues through Step 10.
These steps will improve previous on-the-fly
type diagnostics [1, 2] and are analogous to a
natural human quest; approach a solution by a
crude method and then refine the method.},

	abstract = {Despite their exceptional flexibility and popularity, Monte Carlo methods often suffer from slow mixing times for challenging statistical physics problems. We present a general strategy to overcome this difficulty by adopting ideas and techniques from the machine learning community. We fit the unnormalized probability of the physical model to a feed-forward neural network and reinterpret the architecture as a restricted Boltzmann machine. Then, exploiting its feature detection ability, we utilize the restricted Boltzmann machine to propose efficient Monte Carlo updates to speed up the simulation of the original physical system. We implement these ideas for the Falicov-Kimball model and demonstrate an improved acceptance ratio and autocorrelation time near the phase transition point.},

	abstract = {In this article, an easy to implement global variance reduction procedure is demonstrated. The procedure is capable of flattening the relative error distribution in a global mesh tally covering the geometry of a complex system. The method is fully based on the I/O capabilities of the MCNP Monte Carlo radiation transport code family and requires little additional support code and almost no user judgment to work properly. Increases, with respect to a standard simulation, in a global figure of merit ranging up to a factor 276 for a PWR core configuration have been observed. Also, the relative error distribution was flattened substantially in all studied systems by the application of the procedure and the number of empty mesh tally cells was reduced.},

	abstract = {It is known that a priori information on the distribution of neutron fluxes around a neutron transport model can improve the computational efficiency of Monte Carlo transport calculations. The uncertainty lies in finding a method which obtains this information as fast and effortlessly as possible. A number of global variance reduction techniques were tested on the ITER reference neutronics model for their applicability for performing large three-dimensional transport simulations for ITER. Among these, we propose a new method which is computationally fast and efficient in determining the a priori flux information. The new method, known as MAGIC, was found to perform well achieving an efficiency 74 times that of an analogue run; the next most efficient was FW-CADIS, performing 48 times better than analogue.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation is an unbiased numerical tool for studying classical and quantum many-body systems. One of its bottlenecks is the lack of a general and efficient update algorithm for large size systems close to the phase transition, for which local updates perform badly. In this Rapid Communication, we propose a general-purpose Monte Carlo method, dubbed self-learning Monte Carlo (SLMC), in which an efficient update algorithm is first learned from the training data generated in trial simulations and then used to speed up the actual simulation. We demonstrate the efficiency of SLMC in a spin model at the phase transition point, achieving a 10{\textendash}20 times speedup.},
